# BrewMe
BrewMe is an alcohol content sensing system for use in the beer brewing process. The system will track the alcohol content over time and notify users via email when important brewing milestones are reached. Our focus this semester is to select and implement one alcohol content sensor that notifies users upon reaching some trigger level. Moving forwards, other important sensing data, temperature for example, could be included through the implementation of more sensors. With enough investment, this project could perfect the brewing process, yielding the perfect batch of beer every time for the at-home brewer.
